			<p>据艾媒前沿科技产业研究中心数据，2019年中国人工智能核心产业规模超510亿元，预计2025年人工智能市场规模将达4000亿元。科技的进步和人们日益增长的物质需求将人工智能推向时代的风口浪尖。<br>According to iiMedia Research, China's AI core industry size exceeded 51 billion yuan in 2019, and the AI market size is expected to reach 400 billion yuan in 2025. Advances in technology and people's growing material needs have pushed artificial intelligence to the cusp of the times.</p>
			<p>脱口秀演员Norah曾是普华永道的一名员工，她也表示：“之前最赚钱的地方可以说是‘四大’，但现在发展好的大多都是科技公司。”<br>Stand-up comedian Norah, a former employee of PricewaterhouseCoopers, also said, "The most profitable places before were arguably the 'Big Four,' but now most of the ones that are doing well are technology companies." </p>
			<p>不仅是主流公司的迭代，部分工种被人工智能取代也成为大势所趋。《人工智能时代的未来职业报告》指出满足“五秒钟准则”的劳动者将会最先受到技术的冲击，即如果人可以在5秒钟以内对需要决策的问题做出决定，则这项工作就很有可能被人工智能取代。比如，对于以与人交流为主体工作的公关而言，被取代率仅为1.4%，比淘汰率最高的电话推销员低近97个百分点。<br>Not only the iteration of mainstream companies, some types of jobs replaced by artificial intelligence has also become a general trend. The Future of Careers in the Age of Artificial Intelligence report states that workers who meet the "five-second guideline" will be the first to be impacted by technology, meaning that if a person can make a decision on a problem requiring a decision in less than five seconds, the job is likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence. For example, the replacement rate for publicist, which is primarily a human interaction job, is only 1.4 percent, nearly 97 percentage points lower than the highest elimination rate of telemarketers.</p>

			<p>挑战是相对的。目前，西恩正在剧作领域深造，她不仅不担心自己会被机器人淘汰，而且还对应对读者思维机器化的趋势充满自信：“人性中最基本的东西不会泯灭，真情总是会打动人的。”<br>Challenges are relative. Currently, Sean is furthering her education in playwriting, and not only is she not worried that she will be eliminated by robots, but she is confident that she can counter the trend toward machine-like thinking for readers: "The most basic things in human nature will not die out, and truth will always move people."</p>
            <p>8：00开始观看一部影片、18：00之前总结出情节要点是西恩一天的任务，虽然很多初学者都在做着同样的工作，但在他们看来“一千个人心中有一千个哈姆雷特”、带有个性色彩的文字是迷人的。“比如读一段文字，我一下子就能知道这是马尔克斯写的。”西恩坚信文字工作者存在的价值。<br>It is Sean's task to start watching a film at 8:00 and summarize the main points of the plot by 18:00. Although many beginners are doing the same job, it seems to them that "there are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people" and that texts with individual colors are fascinating. "Reading a passage, for example, I can tell at once that it was written by Marquez." Sean is a firm believer in the value of the existence of wordsmiths.</p>
			 <p>“机器人生产的东西有严重的同质化问题，”西恩回忆起她在某新媒体客户端的实习经历说道，“它们做不了有创造性的工作。”<br>"There's a serious homogenization problem with what robots produce," says Sean, recalling her internship at a new media client, "they don't have the ability to do creative work."</p>
